Every interactive zone in Vivid needs exactly one focus owner. Let the tvOS focus engine own movement through a
stable graph of focusable controls, or build one custom focusable composite
control. Do not mix the two models.

## Focus Models

Use one of these patterns for a given control.

### Native Focus Graph

Use this for ordinary rows, grids, button groups, sheets, and menus where each
actionable item can be a real focus target.

- Render stable `Button`, `NavigationLink`, or `.focusable(true)` items.
  Every actionable element must be reachable by directional movement alone;
  tvOS has no Tab-key or pointer fallback.
- Use `.focusSection()` on a container so directional movement can enter it
  and land on its nearest focusable child, for example a sidebar column that
  does not line up with the grid beside it.
- Use `.focusScope(namespace)` together with `prefersDefaultFocus(in:)` and
  `resetFocus(in:)` to define where default focus lands inside that scope.
  `focusScope` does not affect directional movement; `focusSection` does.
- Use `@FocusState`, `prefersDefaultFocus`, `defaultFocus`, or `resetFocus` to
  seed or restore focus, not to fight the focus engine on every move.
  `defaultFocus` is evaluated when the view first appears and on automatic
  focus-state updates, not on user-driven moves, unless you pass
  `priority: .userInitiated`.
- Do not move focus programmatically in response to app state unless the
  focused item disappeared. Apple's Human Interface Guidelines say to avoid
  changing focus without the user's interaction; the one exception is moving
  focus to a neighbour when the focused item is removed.
- Rely on the system focus effect. Use `.focusEffectDisabled()` only when the
  control draws its own focus appearance, and keep that appearance visually
  consistent with the platform (scale, lift, highlight).
- Keep the focused subtree mounted and structurally stable while moving focus.
- Attach `onMoveCommand` only at intentional boundaries, such as "Up from the
  first card returns to the top menu." Do not intercept normal in-zone movement.
- Move focus geometry with layout (`padding`, `frame`, alignment), not
  `.offset`, because tvOS resolves focus from layout frames.

Good local examples:

- `TVCatalogGrid`
- `TVLibraryCollectionsView`
- `TVLibraryPillRow`
- `TVSavedAccountCards`

### Composite Focus Control

Use this when the visual control is one logical selector even though it renders
multiple highlighted rows or columns. A cascading selector is the main example.

- Make one container the real focus target with `.focusable(true)` and a single
  `@FocusState`. On tvOS the default `interactions` set already includes
  `.activate`, so `.focusable(true)` and
  `.focusable(true, interactions: .activate)` behave the same; use the
  explicit form only if the view is shared with iOS.
- Render rows as passive labels; do not make them `Button`s and do not attach
  per-row `.focused(...)` bindings.
- Store the highlighted row/column in ordinary `@State`.
- Handle all D-pad movement for the composite with one `onMoveCommand`.
- Commit the highlighted selection on Select, usually with `onTapGesture` on
  the focused container. Use `onExitCommand` for Menu/Back and
  `onPlayPauseCommand` for Play/Pause. Do not use `onKeyPress` for the Siri
  Remote; Apple documents it as hardware-keyboard input only.
- Add useful accessibility labels and button/selected traits to the composite
  or its rendered labels so VoiceOver still describes the action.

Good local example:

- `TVCascadeSelector`

## Do Not Mix Models

The broken pattern is a hybrid control:

- row `Button`s participate in native focus,
- the same rows also use `@FocusState`,
- a parent or window-level handler manually changes that focus in response to
  directional presses.

That gives the same physical remote press to multiple owners. A single directional press can change the highlighted item several times, lose panel focus or reach the tab bar behind the panel.

When this happens, stop adding press interceptors. Decide which focus model the
control should use, then remove the other one.

## Current tab and Settings ownership

Home, Movies, Series and For You are direct root tabs. Movies and Series expose native library sub-tabs within their own page; For You exposes Watchlist, Favourites and Collections. The Profile control opens Settings directly. Do not restore the removed Movies/Series/For You/Profile dropdowns when fixing focus.

Each root owns its own sub-tab selection. A focus move within Movies must not change Series or For You. Keep card identities stable across paging and artwork eviction. Home's spotlight never scales on focus, and Down enters the first row's remembered card, using the first card before any visit. Settings uses one navigation stack for pushed category/account pages; avoid nesting another stack in a pushed Settings page.

## Native catalog menus and detail controls

Sort, Filter and A–Z are real native menus. Do not restore the removed centred sort/filter panels or their directional interception. Load filter facets before enabling the menu. Dismissal belongs to the native menu and should return to its trigger without a delayed focus repair. For You keeps one A–Z selection per sub-tab.

Settings enters the first saved account directly through the row’s default focus. Do not land on Add Profile and then redirect. Detail action geometry and loading placeholders share the same fixed baselines. The Description popup owns a separate scrollable set of text focus targets and closes with Back.

The playback timeline and Info pill share one directional boundary: Up from an idle timeline enters Info; Down returns to the timeline. An active scrub keeps ownership until committed or cancelled. Remote Play/Pause remains available without a separate on-screen transport cluster.

## Retained library panels

These rules apply to the retained library panels; Movies and Series use the native sub-tabs described above. A panel has three conceptual states:

- `closed`: no panel is visible; focus belongs to content or the bar.
- `preview`: a dwell-open panel is visible, but the bar still owns focus and
  the panel is passive.
- `entered`: the user pressed Down or otherwise entered the panel; the panel
  owns focus and the bar is inert until the panel closes.

Implementation details may use booleans, but the state machine above is the
contract. In entered mode, it should be impossible for the bar to accept focus
on another tab behind the panel. Treat `panelHasFocus` as telemetry from the
child panel, not as the source of truth for ownership. The durable ownership
signal is the host's "entered panel" state.

When closing a panel, choose the next owner explicitly:

- Menu/Back closes and returns focus to the panel's bar anchor.
- Down past the last row closes and hands focus to page content.
- Selecting a panel row closes, updates route/scope state, and then hands focus
  to the destination content.

## Debugging Checklist

When tvOS focus feels random, capture logs for the ownership boundary first:

- current focused top-bar item
- open panel
- whether the panel is in preview or entered mode
- whether the panel reports focus
- the panel's internal highlighted item
- every `onMoveCommand` direction handled by the active owner

Unexpected signs:

- the bar logs a different focused tab while a panel is entered,
- a single D-pad press produces multiple panel focus writes,
- panel focus becomes `nil` without an explicit close or content handoff,
- `onMoveCommand` is attached broadly and also expected to pass native movement
  through the same zone.
