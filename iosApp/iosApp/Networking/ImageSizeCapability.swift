/// guarded by a lock instead — same shape as `ServerRegistry`'s
/// `ActiveServerIDSnapshot`.

/// Image URLs stay opaque: the server bakes the chosen variant into the
/// URLs it returns and the client never rewrites them. A larger variant
/// simply arrives as a different URL, which `CachedAsyncImage` /
/// `PosterImageCache` cache independently.
