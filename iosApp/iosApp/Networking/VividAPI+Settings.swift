/// The methods on ``VividAPI`` itself — `effectiveSettings`,
/// `setDeviceSetting`, `getUserSetting` — speak the legacy string-only
/// registry: every value is a string, the scope is implied by which function
/// you call, and an unknown key is accepted silently. These speak the contract
/// instead: values are typed JSON, the scope is explicit and validated against
/// the manifest, and a key that is not in the manifest cannot be named because
/// ``SettingKey`` is generated from it.
///
/// Everything here codes through ``SettingsWireCoding`` rather than the shared
/// `HTTPClient` coders, so a setting value's own object keys never come near a
/// key strategy. See the header of SettingValueModels.swift for the reasoning;
/// the models decode identically under either coder either way.
