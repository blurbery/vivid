//
//  ProfileSettingsWriter.swift
//  Vivid (iOS + tvOS + macOS)
//
//  Writes the profile-scoped preferences — subtitle language / mode / forced,
//  metadata language — through the canonical settings API at `scope=profile`.
//
//  These used to travel as fields on `PUT /profiles/{id}`. The server still
//  accepts that and mirrors the fields into the canonical rows
//  (internal/api/handlers/profiles_settings_sync.go), so the legacy path is not
//  broken — but it is a narrower pipe than the contract: it can only address
//  the profile's own scope, spells "no preference" as the empty string where
//  the contract spells it null, and validates nothing a client sends until the
//  mirror runs. Writing the canonical keys directly is what lets a value
//  authored here read back identically on web and Android, and what will keep
//  working when the legacy fields are eventually retired.
//
//  Reads go through the same batched effective endpoint every other surface
//  uses, so a value overridden at a library, series or device scope is reported
//  as such rather than being silently masked by the profile row this writes.
//
