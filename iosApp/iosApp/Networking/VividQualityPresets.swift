//
//  VividQualityPresets.swift
//  Vivid (iOS + tvOS + macOS)
//
//  The quality picker's resolution and bandwidth presets.
//
//  The server stores two orthogonal values — `playback.preferred_quality` (a
//  resolution cap) and `playback.max_bitrate_kbps` (a bandwidth cap, null for
//  uncapped). This table composes them into the single list a user picks from,
//  and is a field-for-field port of web/src/lib/qualityPresets.ts and Android's
//  QualityPresets.kt so a preset chosen on one platform reads back with the
//  same label on the others.
//
//  Presets live here rather than in the contract on purpose. Baking "high" into
//  an enum member would freeze what it means: retuning 1080p High from 10 to 12
//  Mbps would be a contract change every client has to agree to. As a
//  client-side table it is a one-line edit, and older servers keep working
//  because they only ever see the two axes they already understand.
//
//  This table is the *settings* vocabulary. The in-player quality switcher
//  keeps its own finer-grained ladder (``ApplePlaybackQuality/tiers``), which is
//  what the transcoder's rungs are tuned for and which a user reaches for mid
//  playback rather than as a stored default. The two coexist because a stored
//  preference is a *pair*, never an id — so the two tables can disagree about
//  labels without any stored value being reinterpreted.
