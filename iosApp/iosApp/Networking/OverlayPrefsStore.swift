//
//  OverlayPrefsStore.swift
//  Vivid (iOS + tvOS)
//
//  Cached card-overlay configuration for the signed-in profile.
//  Resolves a single rendered `CardOverlayPrefs` from one of two
//  sources, in this priority:
//    1. The user's saved prefs — the contract key `ui.card_overlays`
//       at profile scope, read through the canonical
//       `GET /settings/values/effective` endpoint. If present, this is
//       the entire source of truth.
//    2. Otherwise, the admin-configured baseline JSON from
//       `GET /settings/overlay-config` (`defaults` field).
//    3. Otherwise, registry defaults (`OverlaySchema.buildDefaults()`).
//
//  The contract stores the document as a JSON object (jsonb), not the
//  JSON string the retired legacy endpoint carried, so reads and
//  writes bridge between `SettingJSONValue` and `OverlaySchema`'s
//  string codec here. Servers that predate the canonical settings API
//  are detected via `SettingsAPIError.serverUpgradeRequired` and fall
//  back to the legacy `card_overlays` user setting, which those
//  servers still accept.
//
//  This is winner-take-all, not layered merging — `setPrefs(_:)`
//  always saves a full document (not a diff), and the matching
//  behavior in the web's `useOverlayPrefs.ts` hook keeps the wire
//  format compatible across clients. Hydrated lazily on first read
//  and refreshed after every save so card views always see the shape
//  they just persisted.
//
//  Uses a `@MainActor` observable singleton, idempotent hydration, and a `clear()` hook
//  for sign-out so the next user doesn't briefly see the previous
//  user's badge layout.
