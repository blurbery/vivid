//
//  The two screens had a verbatim copy of this each — same fields, same
//  sentinel translation, same coalescing for the metadata language — which is
//  how they came to disagree in small ways over time. One implementation means
//  a scope or wire-value fix lands on both platforms at once, which matters
//  more now that the values are contract-validated: a spelling only one screen
//  got right would be a permanent `invalid_value` on the other.
