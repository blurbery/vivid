/// item detail until trailers show up or a window lapses — the same
/// request-then-poll shape `PersonDetailViewModel` uses for person metadata,
/// with its policy (3s cadence, 120s window, settled-poll counter) carried
/// over — plus a floor under the settle counter, because an item refresh can
/// sit on a slow provider far longer than a person refresh does. Two of the
/// three server outcomes never poll at all: `cooldown` (the
/// item was checked within the last week) and `disabled` (every library
/// holding it has remote videos switched off) resolve immediately.
///
/// Both dependencies are injected closures rather than `VividAPI.shared`
/// so the whole state machine is testable headless with scripted responses
/// (the `AIJobPoller` precedent). ``statusMessage`` carries the user-facing
/// copy so iOS and tvOS render identical strings.
///
/// One run at a time; call ``stop()`` when the page leaves the nav stack —
/// this task is not owned by SwiftUI's `.task` lifetime and would otherwise
/// keep polling (and retaining the view model) after the route pops. A run
/// stopped before it reached an outcome (the user opened the movie while the
/// fetch was running) can be picked back up with ``resumeIfInterrupted()``
/// on the next appear, without spending another server-side cooldown slot.
