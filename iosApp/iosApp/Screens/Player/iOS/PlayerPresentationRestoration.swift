/// The player is presented as a `fullScreenCover` keyed off
/// `AppRouter.presentedPlayer`, and `PictureInPictureCoordinator` keeps the
/// engaged `PlayerViewModel` alive after that cover goes away. Restoring is
/// therefore two things that have to happen together: put the cover back, and
/// make the new `PlayerView` adopt the *same* view model. A fresh `PlayerView`
/// mints its own `PlayerViewModel` and calls `loadAndPlay`, which would restart
/// the title from the resume point instead of restoring the session already in
/// flight.
///
/// Everything here is `@MainActor` and single-instance because the presentation
/// it stands for is: one router, one cover, one engaged player at a time.
