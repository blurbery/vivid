//  AppleQualityAxes.swift
//  Vivid (iOS + tvOS + macOS)
//
//  Translation between the single quality id the Apple UI picks from and the
//  two orthogonal values the settings contract stores.
//
//  The contract has no compound quality. `playback.preferred_quality` is an
//  enum of bare resolutions (auto, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 2160p, original) and
//  `playback.max_bitrate_kbps` is a separate nullable bandwidth cap. Apple's
//  ladder — "1080p-high", "720p-medium", "328p" — was never a third axis, only
//  a bitrate written into the resolution string, and the legacy string-only
//  registry stored it verbatim because it validated nothing.
//
//  The canonical endpoint does validate, so sending "1080p-high" now fails the
//  enum with `invalid_value`. Splitting it here is what keeps the preference
//  syncing at all — and it is also what lets a quality chosen on the web or on
//  Android read back correctly here, since those clients have always stored the
//  two axes (web/src/lib/qualityPresets.ts, Android's QualityPresets.kt).
//
//  The Apple bitrate ladder deliberately stays as it is rather than being
//  retuned to match the web's presets: the tiers are what the in-player
//  switcher already offers. The clients agree on the stored *axes*; each
//  client may map those axes onto its own playback rungs without changing the
//  authored resolution or bitrate cap.
//
//  Because the ladders differ, rejoining has to decide what to do with a pair
//  that lands between two Apple rungs. The resolution wins — see ``join``. The
//  bitrate axis is not lost; it is carried separately to the one request shape
//  that can express it.
