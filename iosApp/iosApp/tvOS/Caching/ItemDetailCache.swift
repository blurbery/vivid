/// refresh then fans in corrected userData (watched flags, progress,
/// etc.) without painting a spinner.
///
/// Bounded LRU so we don't retain every screen the user has ever visited
/// for a session. Clearing hooks live in `AuthService` so signing out or

/// doesn't bother with synchronization. Concurrent access from a
