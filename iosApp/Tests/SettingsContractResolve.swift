//  SettingsContractResolve.swift
//  VividTests
//
//  Client-side settings resolution, mirroring the server's
//  `internal/settingsresolve` semantics: the definition's declared resolution
//  order decides which stored value wins, an identity absent from the context
//  drops the scopes that need it, and a policy constraint narrows the answer
//  without destroying what the user authored.
//
//  The Apple clients do not resolve settings in production — they write through
//  `/settings/values` and read effective values back from
//  `/settings/values/effective`, so the server stays the single authority. This
//  resolver exists for one reason: the cross-platform conformance fixture in
//  contracts/settings/v1/conformance.json names a Swift implementation as an
//  independent resolver. Agreement with the server and web implementations is
//  what makes the fixture a drift gate rather than a tautology. It
//  therefore lives in the test target, and every behavioural choice in it is
//  pinned by `SettingsConformanceTests` — do not change one without the fixture
//  agreeing.
//
//  The server implementation is internal/settingsresolve/resolve.go and the
//  web implementation is web/src/lib/settingsResolve.ts. This Swift resolver
//  independently checks the same fixture.
//
//  Everything here is driven by the vendored manifest in
//  Fixtures/SettingsContract/manifest.json rather than by a hand-copied table of
//  keys and defaults. A table would pass the fixture while having drifted from
//  the contract, which is the one failure this file cannot be allowed to have.
