/// The Swift runner for the cross-platform settings conformance fixture — the
/// contract's named drift gate.
///
/// The same hand-authored cases in `contracts/settings/v1/conformance.json` run
/// against the server resolver (`internal/settingsresolve/conformance_test.go`),
/// the web resolver (`web/src/lib/settingsConformance.test.ts`) and this one.
/// Independent resolvers agreeing on every case is the whole point, so this
/// runner takes the fixture at face value: it decodes strictly, resolves through
/// `resolveSettingValues` against the real vendored manifest, and compares every
/// declared expectation.
///
/// Both JSON files are pinned from the server repo; the manifest's advisory
/// notes may be shortened as described in the SOURCE file. Nothing here
/// touches the network.
///
/// Four things fail this suite, and each of them is drift:
///
/// 1. A resolution disagreement — this client would show a user a different
///    effective setting than the server resolves.
/// 2. A manifest revision mismatch between the fixture, the vendored manifest,
///    and the generated `SettingKey`. A revision bump changes definitions, so
///    the expectations have to be re-derived rather than assumed to still hold.
/// 3. A key the bindings and the vendored manifest disagree about, which catches
///    the two JSON files being vendored from different server commits — skew the
///    revision check cannot see, since a revision only moves on a manifest PR
///    and both copies would still read the same number.
/// 4. A fixture field this runner does not know. Schema drift in the fixture is
///    itself drift: a field one platform reads and another silently skips means
///    the platforms are no longer running the same cases, which is precisely the
///    failure the fixture exists to prevent. Strictness here is not pedantry —
///    it is the only thing keeping a silent skip from looking like a pass.
///
/// Swift has no `DisallowUnknownFields`, so strictness is two passes over the
/// same bytes: a typed decode for the values, and a walk of the raw tree that
/// rejects an unknown field at every level and answers the one question typed
/// decoding cannot — whether `stored_value` was absent or authored as JSON null.
